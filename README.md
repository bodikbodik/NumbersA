# Linear calculations (Numbers 1)

## Task 1
A two-digit number **_n_** is given. Find its left digit (the tens digit).  


Example 

```
n = 45  =>  result = 4
n = 80  =>  result = 8
n = 69  =>  result = 6
```

## Task 2
A two-digit number **_n_** is given. Find the sum and the product of its digits.


Example 

```
n = 45  =>  sum = 9,  product = 20
n = 80  =>  sum = 8,  product = 0
n = 69  =>  sum = 15, product = 54
```

## Task 3
A three-digit number **_n_** is given. Find the sum and the product of its digits.  


Example 

```
n = 450  =>  sum = 9,  product = 0
n = 817  =>  sum = 16, product = 56
n = 695  =>  sum = 20, product = 270
```

## Task 4
A three-digit number **_n_** is given. The first left digit was crossed out and ascribed to the right. Find the obtained number.  


Example 

```
n = 450  =>  result = 504
n = 807  =>  result = 78
n = 695  =>  result = 956
```
